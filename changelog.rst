Changelog
=========

- 0.6.3
    - enforce rustfmt style checking
    - more explicit error messages when checking the structure of a ``CsMat``
    - ``into_raw_storage`` allows recylcling the storage of a ``CsMat``
    - support more ndarray versions
    - initial ``serde`` support
    - add more genericity over index type for ``CsMat`` construction functions.
    - ``CsMatBase`` now derives ``Clone``.
- 0.6.2
    - add support for symmetric matrices in Matrix Market IO
    - fix bug with adjacent empty columns in CSR matrix iteration.
- 0.6.1
    - fix ``to_dense`` for non-square matrices
    - improve performance of sparse-dense dot products and matrix vector
      products.
    - add support for Matrix Market IO.
- 0.6.0
    - enable the selection of the integer type for storing indices in matrix
      types **breaking change**
    - update to ndarray 0.10
    - refactor triplet matrix to use the same idioms used in compressed matrix
      **breaking change**
    - enhance documentation of main data structures
    - permutation constructor for identity permutation now requires the dimension
      on which the permutation should operate **breaking change**
- 0.5.0
    - adapt to breaking changes in ndarray 0.7
- 0.4.1:
    - add ``insert()`` method to insert an element inside an owned csmat
    - add ``outer_iterator_mut()`` method to enable changing the non-zero
      values of a sparse matrix while keeping its structure constant.
    - remove unsafe usage in the library
- 0.4.0:
    - panic for contract violations, use errors only for recoverable problems
      **breaking change**
    - depend on latest ndarray version: 0.6 **braking change**
    - refactor API to present shorter import paths **breaking change**
    - expose sparse matrix / dense vector product via ``Mul``.
    - add an example of building and solving a sparse linear system
- O.4.0-alpha.4 version, most changes are **breaking changes**:
    - move cholesky factorization into its own crate
    - add ``to_dense()`` method for sparse matrices
    - rename ``borrowed()`` into ``view()``
    - ``outer_iterator()`` no longer returns the index of the dimension we're
      iterating. The old behavior can be obtained by chaining a call
      to ``enumerate()``.
    - ``eye()`` returns a csr matrix by default, a csc matrix can be obtained
      using ``eye_csc()``.
    - rename ``new_borrowed()`` into ``new_view()``.
    - rename ``new_raw()`` into ``new_view_raw()``.
    - rename ``new_owned()`` into ``new()`` or ``new_csc()`` depending on the
      desired ordering, and have the ownning constructors panic on bad input.
    - constructors now take a tuple for shape information
- 0.4.0-alpha.3:
    - rename ``at`` family of functions into ``get``, consistent with the naming
      scheme in standard library. **breaking change**
    - move cholesky factorization behind the "lgpl" feature flag
      **rbeaking change**
    - per-nnz-element function application (``map``, ``map_inplace``).
    - binary operations operating on matching non-zero elements
      (``csvec_binop``, ``csmat_binop``).
    - introduce ``nnz_index`` to retrieve an index of an element allowing
      for later constant time access.
- 0.4.0-alpha.2:
    - functions in the ``at`` family will return references **breaking change**
    - simpler arguments for ``at_outer_inner`` **breaking change**
    - mutable view types
- 0.4.0-alpha.1:
    - depend on ndarray for dense matrices **breaking change**
    - iterators return reference where possible **breaking change**
