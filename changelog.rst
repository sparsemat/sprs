Changelog
=========

- 0.11.3
  - Fixed a bug where Iptr -> I conversion was not checked

- 0.11.2
  - Fixed a compilation regression in csmat_binop
  - Bump MSRV (1.77)
  - add support for reading/writing Complex{32,64} matrices in matrixmarket format.
    Also change semantics so that files of kind  {integer,real,complex} are only readable
    into matrices of the same kind (so integer can be read into [iu]{8,16,32,64,size}),
    real into u{32,64}, complex into Complex{32,64}.  And raise a meaningful error if
    the user tries something that produces a mismatch.

    Also make skew-symmetric and symmetric matrices work for complex values.
  - add support for reading hermitian complex matrices in matrixmarket format.
    Of course, reading non-complex hermitian matrices is nonsensical, so this
    raises an error (on the off-chance that some other matrixmarket writer
    can write such matrices).

- 0.11.0
  - ``MulAcc`` is generalised to allow different output types from input
  - Bump `ndarray` to `0.15`. This requires a bump in MSRV to `1.49`
